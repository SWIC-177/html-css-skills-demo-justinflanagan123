      <p>
        Hey all, I am a student at
        <a href="https://www.swic.edu/" class="text-blue-500">SWIC</a> and I'm
        trying to get my Associate in Applied Science Graphic Communications.
        Coding is something I fell in love with during my high school year at
        <a
          href="https://sites.google.com/columbia4.org/chseagles/home"
          class="text-blue-500"
          >Columbia</a
        >. After a few coding classes, I realized that this was something I want
        to pursue as a career. For now, I work as a MSA at the Monroe County
        YMCA, which is just a front desk person. I like my job, the people are
        very kind to me and a huge plus is that I get a free membership. I hope
        in the future I can achieve my goal of being a web developer.
      </p>

          I love to watch Horror Movies. I'm a sucker for chessy ones. The
          Ritual has to be my all time favorite one. When it come to my favorite
          horror series it's got to be V/H/S.

          Working out is a big thing to me. I started going to the gym around
          2018 to lose weight. While I was working out I got an invitation to go
          powerlifting and really enjoy it. I did two competitions and they
          where a ton of fun, but for now I have taken a break due to back
          issues.

          I'm very big into video games. I have a PC right now but in the pass
          I've had Xbox"s and PlayStation's. Right now I am playing Pal World

          I'm a pretty big fan of wrestling. I've falling out of it recently but
