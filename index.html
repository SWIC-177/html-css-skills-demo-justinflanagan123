      Hello my name is Justin and this is my personal bio page! I will be
      sharing some thing about my stuff and where I am in life.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hey all, I am a student at <a href="https://www.swic.edu/">swic</a> and
      I'm trying to get my Associate in Applied Science Graphic Communications.
      Coding is something I fell in love with turing my high school year at
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/columbia4.org/chseagles/home"
        >Columbia</a
      >. After a few coding coding classes i realized that this was something I
      want to pursue as a career. For now I work as a MSA at the Monroe County
      YMCA, which is just a front desk person. I like my job, the people are
      very kind to me and a huge plus is that I get a free membership. I hope in
      the future I can achieve my goal of being a web developer.
    </p>
